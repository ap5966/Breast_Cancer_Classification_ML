# Breast_Cancer_Classification_ML
The "Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning" repository contains a machine learning project that aims to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign. The project uses various machine learning algorithms to analyze breast cancer data and make accurate predictions.
The dataset used for training and testing the models contains features extracted from biopsy images, and the project explores techniques such as logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, and neural networks for classification.

# Contents:
**1. Jupyter Notebooks:** Contains Python notebooks with code for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

**2. Data:** Includes the breast cancer dataset used for training and testing the models.

**3. Models:** Store trained machine learning models for classification.

# Objectives:
1. Develop a reliable breast cancer classification model for early detection and diagnosis.
2. Evaluate different machine learning algorithms to identify the best-performing model.
3. Use data visualization to gain insights into feature importance and model performance.

Let's collaborate and build an impactful Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning repository to support healthcare and improve cancer diagnosis!
